# A-NOVEL-DENOISING-AND-SEGMENTATION-OF-BRAIN-TUMOR-IN-MRI-IMAGES
In this Project,
->Brain tumor segmentation on brain MRI images is done using MATLAB.
->Denoising and Segmentation algorithms such as "Anisotropic Diffusion Filter" and "Fast Bounding Box" are used for improved performance.
->One class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is opted for substantial training of sample set.
->Finally opting the one class SVM classifier involving the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is employed for locating exact tumor portion and isolate it from useful healthy texture region in MRI images.
